This is a water-fight playground game of survival. 

The goal of the game is to be the last one standing with water still in your cup. 

## Equipment
* Paper cups. I tested with 4oz paper "Souffle" cups.
* A bucket of water.

## Setup:
* Give everyone a cup
* Fill their cup from a shared bucket of water you may start.

## Begin:
* Raise your cups and say "Cheers."

## Lose
* Spill your cup of water.
    * Put your cup back in the bucket
    * Throw out your cup if it is too damaged to play again

## Win
* Bump, scare, tip or knock over everyone else's water out of their cups.
* Wait for other people to eliminate eachother.

## House rules: 
* Hold you cup in the palm of your hand with your fingers outstretched.
* Get everyone to agree to clean up after you play.
