subtitle: A water-fight (maximize play; minimize setup)
---

## Goal
* Be the last one with (the most) water still in your cup. 

## Setup:
* Give everyone a cup of water.

## Begin:
* Raise your cups and say "Last cupful".
  * Raising your cup lets everyone know you are ready to play.

## Lose
* Spill your cup of water.
* Once you have no water in your cup you are out for that round (not allowed to attack anyone else).

## Win
* Bump or 
* Scare everyone else's water out of their cups.

## Rematch
* Refill cups.
  * A big o' bucket of water makes this easiest.
## Details

### Equipment
* Paper cups.
    * 4 oz "Dixie" cups.

* A bucket of water: because refilling is much faster when everyone can dip their cup in to restart.

### House rules: 
* A large open space that can get wet is best. Anywhere you would have a waterballoon fight.
* Get everyone to agree to clean up after you play.
* Hold your cup in the palm of your hand with your fingers outstretched.

### Variants:
* Informal teams?
* Formal teams?
* Someone with a larger cup?

#### Did not work well

* 4oz paper "Souffle" cups:
    * When filled with water these collapsed into disks too quickly. Kids only got one round out of the cups.
