## Goal
* Be the last one with any water in your cup.

## Setup:
* Find an open outdoor space
* Fill everyone’s cups with water

## Game play:
* Raise your cups and yell “Last cup standing”.
* Knock the water out of everyone else’s cups.
* When there is no more water in your cup, you are eliminated from this round.

## Win
* Be the last one with water left in your cup.

## Rematch
* Refill cups.
  * A big o' bucket of water makes this easiest.


## Details

### Equipment
* Paper cups.
    * 4 oz "Dixie" cups.

* A bucket of water: because refilling is much faster when everyone can dip their cup in to restart.

### House rules: 
* A large open space that can get wet is best. Anywhere you would have a waterballoon fight.
* Get everyone to agree to clean up after you play.
* Hold your cup in the palm of your hand with your fingers outstretched.
  * When playing with little ones (1st graders) let them just hold the cup.
  * For an extra challenge place your cup on the back of your hand.

### Variants:
* Informal teams?
* Formal teams?
* Someone with a larger cup?

#### Did not work well

* 4oz paper "Souffle" cups:
    * When filled with water these collapsed into disks too quickly. Kids only got one round out of the cups.
