## Search Tips for Interviews

When you need quick answers during pair programming:

1. **Use CMD+P in your IDE** - Type filename keywords (e.g., "swift", "testing", "architecture")
2. **Use CMD+F within files** - Search for specific terms once file is open
3. **Check Table of Contents** - Each guide has a comprehensive TOC at the top
4. **Company prep first** - Review company-specific guide before the interview
