# SwiftUI State Management: Complete Guide
## Understanding @State, @Binding, @StateObject, @ObservedObject, @EnvironmentObject

---

## Overview Table

| Property Wrapper | Ownership | Lifecycle | Use Case | Value/Reference |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| @State | View owns data | Tied to view | Simple value types in single view | Value type |
| @Binding | View borrows data | Parent controls | Two-way connection to parent's state | Reference to value |
| @StateObject | View owns object | View creates & owns | Reference type owned by view | Reference type |
| @ObservedObject | View observes object | External ownership | Reference type owned elsewhere | Reference type |
| @EnvironmentObject | View observes object | Injected from ancestor | Shared data across view hierarchy | Reference type |

---

## @State

### What It Is
- For **simple value types** (Int, String, Bool, structs)
- The view **owns** this data
- **Private** to the view
- SwiftUI manages the storage and lifecycle

### When to Use
- Simple, view-local data that doesn't need to be shared
- Temporary UI state (toggles, text field values, selection states)
- When the data is a **value type** (struct, enum, primitives)

### Example
```swift
struct CounterView: View {
    @State private var count = 0  // View owns this
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Count: \(count)")
            Button("Increment") {
                count += 1  // Modifying causes view to redraw
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Points
- Always mark as `private` (it's view-local)
- SwiftUI recreates the view struct on state changes, but preserves @State values
- Stored **outside** the view struct in SwiftUI's internal storage
- Perfect for simple UI state that stays within one view

### What Happens Under the Hood
```swift
// Conceptually, SwiftUI does something like:
// 1. View struct is created
// 2. @State property is stored in separate SwiftUI-managed storage
// 3. View gets a reference to that storage
// 4. When state changes, view is marked for redraw
```

---

## @Binding

### What It Is
- A **two-way connection** to someone else's @State or other property
- The view **does not own** the data
- Creates a reference to the parent's source of truth

### When to Use
- Child view needs to read **and write** parent's data
- Creating reusable components that modify external state
- When you need two-way data flow

### Example
```swift
// Parent owns the data
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var isOn = false
    
    var body: some View {
        ToggleChildView(isOn: $isOn)  // Pass binding with $
    }
}

// Child receives and can modify the data
struct ToggleChildView: View {
    @Binding var isOn: Bool  // No $ here in declaration
    
    var body: some View {
        Toggle("Power", isOn: $isOn)  // Use $ when passing to another view
    }
}
```

### Key Points
- Use `$` prefix to pass a binding: `$propertyName`
- Child can read and write, but parent maintains ownership
- Changes propagate back to the source of truth
- Enables component reusability

### Common Pattern: Custom Components
```swift
struct CustomTextField: View {
    @Binding var text: String
    let placeholder: String
    
    var body: some View {
        TextField(placeholder, text: $text)
            .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle())
            .padding()
    }
}

// Usage
struct FormView: View {
    @State private var username = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        CustomTextField(text: $username, placeholder: "Username")
    }
}
```

---

## @StateObject vs @ObservedObject

These two are the most confusing. The key difference is **ownership**.

### @StateObject

#### What It Is
- For **reference types** (classes conforming to `ObservableObject`)
- The view **owns and creates** the object
- Object persists for the view's entire lifetime
- SwiftUI ensures it's only initialized **once**

#### When to Use
- When THIS view should create and own the object
- The view is the "source of truth" for this object
- You want the object to survive view updates

#### Example
```swift
class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var items: [String] = []
    
    func loadItems() {
        // Load data...
        items = ["Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"]
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()  // Created once
    
    var body: some View {
        List(viewModel.items, id: \.self) { item in
            Text(item)
        }
        .onAppear {
            viewModel.loadItems()
        }
    }
}
```

#### Critical Behavior
```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var counter = 0
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ChildView(count: counter)
            Button("Rerender Child") { counter += 1 }
        }
    }
}

struct ChildView: View {
    let count: Int
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()  // Only created ONCE
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Count: \(count), VM items: \(viewModel.items.count)")
    }
}
// Even though ChildView re-renders when count changes,
// viewModel is NOT recreated. It persists.
```

### @ObservedObject

#### What It Is
- For **reference types** (classes conforming to `ObservableObject`)
- The view **does not own** the object
- Object is created and owned **elsewhere**
- Passed in from a parent

#### When to Use
- When the object is created by a parent or dependency injection
- Multiple views need to observe the same object
- You're passing an existing object down the view hierarchy

#### Example
```swift
class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var items: [String] = []
}

struct ParentView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()  // Parent creates
    
    var body: some View {
        ChildView(viewModel: viewModel)  // Pass to child
    }
}

struct ChildView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: ViewModel  // Child observes
    
    var body: some View {
        List(viewModel.items, id: \.self) { item in
            Text(item)
        }
    }
}
```

#### Critical Behavior - The Gotcha!
```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var counter = 0
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ChildView(count: counter)
            Button("Rerender Child") { counter += 1 }
        }
    }
}

struct ChildView: View {
    let count: Int
    @ObservedObject var viewModel = ViewModel()  // ❌ WRONG! Created on EVERY render
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Count: \(count), VM items: \(viewModel.items.count)")
    }
}
// Every time count changes, ChildView re-renders and creates a NEW ViewModel!
// You'll lose all state. Use @StateObject instead.
```

### The Golden Rule

```
If the view creates the object → @StateObject
If the object is passed in → @ObservedObject
```

## @EnvironmentObject

### What It Is
- For **reference types** shared across many views
- Injected into the environment by an ancestor view
- Available to all descendant views without explicit passing
- Like dependency injection at the view hierarchy level

### When to Use
- Data needs to be accessible by many views at different levels
- Avoiding "prop drilling" (passing data through many layers)
- App-wide state (user session, settings, theme)

### Example
```swift
class UserSettings: ObservableObject {
    @Published var username = "Guest"
    @Published var isDarkMode = false
}

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    @StateObject private var settings = UserSettings()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environmentObject(settings)  // Inject into environment
        }
    }
}

// Deep in the hierarchy - no need to pass through intermediate views
struct DeepNestedView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var settings: UserSettings  // Access directly
    
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, \(settings.username)")
    }
}

// Another view can also access it
struct ProfileView: View {
    @EnvironmentObject var settings: UserSettings
    
    var body: some View {
        Toggle("Dark Mode", isOn: $settings.isDarkMode)
    }
}
```

### Key Points
- Must be injected with `.environmentObject()` by an ancestor
- App will crash if you use @EnvironmentObject but nobody provided it
- Great for avoiding prop drilling
- Use for truly shared, app-wide state

### Preview Support
```swift
struct ProfileView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ProfileView()
            .environmentObject(UserSettings())  // Provide for preview
    }
}
```

---

## ObservableObject Protocol

All reference types used with @StateObject, @ObservedObject, and @EnvironmentObject must conform to `ObservableObject`.

### Basic Implementation
```swift
class MyViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var name = ""      // Auto-notifies on change
    @Published var count = 0
    
    var notObserved = ""           // Changes don't trigger updates
    
    func doSomething() {
        name = "Updated"            // View automatically updates
    }
}
```

### @Published
- Marks properties that should trigger view updates
- Automatically calls `objectWillChange.send()` before the value changes
- Only works with class properties (not struct)

### Manual Change Notification
```swift
class MyViewModel: ObservableObject {
    var items: [String] = [] {
        didSet {
            objectWillChange.send()  // Manual notification
        }
    }
}
```

## Decision Flow Chart

```
Need to store data in a view?
│
├─ Is it a simple value type (Int, String, Bool, struct)?
│  └─ Use @State
│
├─ Is it a reference type (class)?
│  │
│  ├─ Does THIS view create and own it?
│  │  └─ Use @StateObject
│  │
│  └─ Is it passed from a parent?
│     └─ Use @ObservedObject
│
└─ Need to modify parent's data?
   └─ Use @Binding

Need data across many unrelated views?
└─ Use @EnvironmentObject
```

## Common Patterns & Best Practices

### Pattern 1: View Model with Child Views
```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ParentViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            HeaderView(title: $viewModel.title)
            ContentView(viewModel: viewModel)
        }
    }
}

struct HeaderView: View {
    @Binding var title: String  // Two-way binding for editing
    
    var body: some View {
        TextField("Title", text: $title)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: ParentViewModel  // Observe parent's VM
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(viewModel.content)
    }
}
```

### Pattern 2: App-Wide State
```swift
class AppState: ObservableObject {
    @Published var user: User?
    @Published var isAuthenticated = false
}

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    @StateObject private var appState = AppState()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            if appState.isAuthenticated {
                HomeView()
            } else {
                LoginView()
            }
        }
        .environmentObject(appState)
    }
}
```

### Pattern 3: Reusable Components
```swift
struct RatingView: View {
    @Binding var rating: Int
    let maxRating: Int
    
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            ForEach(1...maxRating, id: \.self) { star in
                Image(systemName: star <= rating ? "star.fill" : "star")
                    .onTapGesture { rating = star }
            }
        }
    }
}

// Usage
struct ProductView: View {
    @State private var rating = 3
    
    var body: some View {
        RatingView(rating: $rating, maxRating: 5)
    }
}
```

## Common Mistakes & How to Fix

### Mistake 1: Using @ObservedObject When You Should Use @StateObject
```swift
// ❌ WRONG
struct MyView: View {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel = ViewModel()  // Recreated on every render!
    
    var body: some View { ... }
}

// ✅ CORRECT
struct MyView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()  // Created once
    
    var body: some View { ... }
}
```

### Mistake 2: Forgetting $ When Passing Bindings
```swift
// ❌ WRONG
ChildView(isOn: isOn)  // Passes the value, not a binding

// ✅ CORRECT
ChildView(isOn: $isOn)  // Passes a binding
```

### Mistake 3: Making @State Public
```swift
// ❌ WRONG
struct MyView: View {
    @State var count = 0  // Should be private
}

// ✅ CORRECT
struct MyView: View {
    @State private var count = 0
}
```

### Mistake 4: Using @State for Reference Types
```swift
// ❌ WRONG
struct MyView: View {
    @State var viewModel = ViewModel()  // Reference type with @State
}

// ✅ CORRECT
struct MyView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()
}
```

## Interview Questions You Might Get

### Q: "What's the difference between @State and @StateObject?"
**A:** @State is for value types (structs, enums, primitives) that are owned by the view, while @StateObject is for reference types (classes conforming to ObservableObject) that are owned and created by the view. @StateObject ensures the object is only created once during the view's lifetime, even if the view re-renders.

### Q: "When would you use @ObservedObject vs @StateObject?"
**A:** Use @StateObject when the view creates and owns the object - it ensures the object is initialized once and persists for the view's lifetime. Use @ObservedObject when the object is created elsewhere (like a parent view) and passed in - the view just observes it but doesn't own it.

### Q: "How do @Binding and @State work together?"
**A:** @State creates a source of truth in a parent view, and @Binding creates a two-way connection to that state from a child view. The parent passes a binding using the $ prefix ($propertyName), allowing the child to both read and write the parent's state.

### Q: "Why would you use @EnvironmentObject instead of passing @ObservedObject through the view hierarchy?"
**A:** @EnvironmentObject avoids "prop drilling" - passing data through multiple intermediate views that don't need it. It's ideal for app-wide state like user authentication or theme settings that many disconnected views need to access.

### Q: "What happens if you use @ObservedObject where you should use @StateObject?"
**A:** The object will be recreated every time the view re-renders, losing all its state. This is a common bug that can cause unexpected behavior and performance issues.

## Memory Aid

**Ownership:**
- @State: I own it (value type)
- @StateObject: I own it (reference type)
- @Binding: Someone else owns it, I can modify it
- @ObservedObject: Someone else owns it, they passed it to me
- @EnvironmentObject: Someone up the tree owns it, everyone can access it

**Type:**
- Value types → @State or @Binding
- Reference types → @StateObject, @ObservedObject, or @EnvironmentObject

**Lifecycle:**
- @State: Tied to view, recreated with view
- @StateObject: Created once, survives view updates
- @ObservedObject: Managed externally
- @EnvironmentObject: Managed by ancestor

---

## Quick Reference Code

```swift
// LOCAL VALUE TYPE
@State private var count = 0

// LOCAL REFERENCE TYPE
@StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()

// RECEIVED BINDING
@Binding var isOn: Bool

// PASSED REFERENCE TYPE
@ObservedObject var sharedVM: SharedViewModel

// ENVIRONMENT SHARED TYPE
@EnvironmentObject var settings: AppSettings

// PASSING A BINDING
ChildView(text: $myText)

// INJECTING ENVIRONMENT
ContentView()
    .environmentObject(mySettings)
```

Good luck with your interview! These concepts are fundamental to SwiftUI and will definitely come up.
