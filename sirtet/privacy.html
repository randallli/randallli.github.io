    <h1>Sirtet Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Sirtet ("we", "us", "our", or "app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
      handle information when you use the Sirtet application on iOS.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Sirtet is a puzzle game that operates offline and does not require an account to play. We do not collect personal
      information such as your name, email address, or location.
    </p>

    <h3>Game Data</h3>
    <p>
      Your game progress, scores, and preferences are stored locally on your device only. This data is never sent to our
      servers unless you explicitly choose to sync or save to cloud storage through Apple's services.
    </p>

    <h3>Crash Reporting</h3>
    <p>
      To improve app stability, Sirtet uses Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports and error logs. This data:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is sent only when a crash occurs</li>
      <li>Contains technical information about the crash (stack trace, device model, iOS version)</li>
      <li>Does not include personal identifying information</li>
      <li>Is used only to fix bugs and improve app performance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Analytics</h3>
    <p>
      Sirtet uses Firebase Analytics to understand how users interact with the app. This helps us:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify which features are most popular</li>
      <li>Detect performance issues</li>
      <li>Plan future improvements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Analytics data includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>App events (game started, game completed, settings changed)</li>
      <li>Device information (iOS version, device model)</li>
      <li>Basic usage metrics (session duration, feature usage)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Analytics does not track personal identifying information or behavior outside the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Sirtet uses the following third-party services:
    </p>

    <h3>Firebase (Google Cloud)</h3>
    <p>
      Firebase provides analytics and crash reporting services. Google's data practices are governed by their
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.
      Firebase does not store personal data associated with your device without explicit user permission.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      Game data stored locally on your device is protected by iOS's standard security mechanisms. We do not store data
      on remote servers without your consent. Firebase data is encrypted in transit and at rest according to Google's
      security standards.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Sirtet does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. The app is age-rated 4+ on the
      App Store and suitable for all ages. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with information,
      we will delete such information immediately.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by updating the
      "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated
      Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a California resident, you have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, or shared.
      Since Sirtet does not collect personal information, most CCPA provisions do not apply. However, crash reports and
      analytics may be considered under CCPA's definition of information. You can control this through your device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>
      If you are in the European Union, we comply with GDPR requirements. Sirtet does not collect personal data and
      operates without a legal basis requirement. Firebase's use of data is governed by Google's Data Processing Agreement.
