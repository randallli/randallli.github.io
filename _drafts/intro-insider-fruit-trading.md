Thank you for taking the time to check out Insider Fruit Trading at Play NYC, especially those who played on the floor.

We played at least 15 complete games, testing multiple parameters. We confirmed improvements, as well as some adjustments that will not be included in the final game. I will be sharing the analysis with my [Patreon supporters](https:/patreon.com/TripleLi), so please consider joining to learn more, offer suggestions, or contribute to the project financially ($$).

My favorite quote of the evening:

> I figured out a great strategy: 'buy low and sell high.' I guess that isn't something new I invented.

I also heard someone quote Seneca:

> Luck Is What Happens When Preparation Meets Opportunity

I had difficulty reading some emails on the signup sheet so if know your friends have bad handwriting, or they did not get this message, please ask them to sign up. Feel free to share with others too.
