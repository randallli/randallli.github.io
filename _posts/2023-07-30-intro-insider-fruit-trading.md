If you're around this weekend: I will be testing multiple versions of Insider Fruit Trading, a board game I'm working on, at Play NYC on August 5-6. [Tickets on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/play-nyc-2023-tickets-573315240317) will be 25% off with discount code **TripleLi23**. Please [support me on Patreon](https://patreon.com/TripleLi) with the savings and can keep up to date on my latest work.

Looks like there are going to be a bunch of games available to play from NYC developers. I will be set up with the tabletop games for play testing. Come say hi and play.

If you can't make it, reach out and we can play some time after the event too.
